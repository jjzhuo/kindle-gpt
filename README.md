https://kindle-gpt.com is a website I built for the Kindle e-ink browser, a tool that lets you converse with GPT on your Kindle.

I spend a lot of time on my Kindle Scribe. The reading experience is far superior to that on computer or phone screens. Lately I've also been spending a lot of time on ChatGPT. However, the Kindle browser is so crippled that most modern websites are unusable on it.

This inspired me to develop a solution in my free time: a ChatGPT like experience optimized for the Kindle browser, built on the good old server-side rendered web pages.

This repo is for issue tracking for now. I plan to open source the web page rendering code at some point.
